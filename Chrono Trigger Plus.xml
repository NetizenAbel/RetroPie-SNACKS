    <desc>This hack adds a ton of cut content back into the game, allows access to previously unexplorable areas, fixes some bugs and offers some options to remove the linearity from the game. Full list of changes in the readme.

Version 2.0 is the most content filled bug free version yet, 1999 is fully explorable and offers tons of stuff to do. As well as more Easter eggs and quality of life improvements.

2.1 adds the option to do some sidequests earlier, and lets fair prizes and cats carry over.

Because of the Speed Shoes item the Autorun patch is now pre-applied, however it is still included for those that want it for other hacks or projects.</desc>
