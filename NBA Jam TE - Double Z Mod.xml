    <name>NBA Jam TE - Double Z Mod</name>
    <desc>A “Roaring ’90s” extravaganza, eskayelle has released v3.9.9 of his Double Z Mod of the SNES classic, NBA Jam Tournament Edition. Enhancements to the original game include the following:

Forget the Rookies! Now play as the 1992 Dream Team!
Bugs from the original game have been fixed, i.e., the Grand Champions and Injuries bugs.
Assets from the original game have been restored, such as the Mortal Kombat banners.
Battle the 27 NBA teams from worst to first, based on 1992-93 conference standings and playoffs results.
Tons of new secret characters, including Hulk Hogan, David Hasselhoff, Arnie (as the T-800), and more!
Play as the 72-10 1996 Chicago Bulls!
Play as the Motor City Bad Boys!
Play as “The Worm”, Dennis Rodman, on at least four teams!
Play as a new Underdogs team, pairing up some secret characters and other interesting match-ups.
Expanded rosters are now as easy as inputting the Konami code.
Please check out the readme for a full-blown rundown of the progress to make the hack, including some details on ASM and hex edits!

Big thanks to phonymike, Mattrizzle, EMiller518, JCE3000GT, dext3r, DackR, and others for assets, guidance, editors, tutorials, and more! Plus Gauveldt and DarkSamus993 for the tips on hacking sound, and Wake for helping develop the first run of clips!</desc>
