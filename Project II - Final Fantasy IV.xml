    <name>Project II - Final Fantasy IV</name>
    <desc>Project II: Final Fantasy IV is an extensive script rewrite of Final Fantasy II for Super Nintendo, made largely with Pinkpuff’s FF4kster. When FFII released in 1991, it came with a subpar script. Through the years Final Fantasy IV received many English script revisions, but nearly all ports of the game have long load screens, lag, and sound issues. In addition, a wide swath of enhancements and bug fixes are only available for the English Super NES version.

One may ask, “Why not play J2e’s patch?” Unfortunately, J2e’s translation is rife with messy hacking, memes, and a script that was half made up and half pulled from the English SNES script. Project II’s goal is to stay truer to the real FFIV.

Enter the Crusade for the Crystals once more with Project II!
